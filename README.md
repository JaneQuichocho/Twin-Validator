#### A Short Description of Our Project 

#### What will our app do? 
Our web application will use the Microsoft Azure Face API and the WebRTC API to compare two faces, giving a percentage on how much they look alike. The user can upload pictures by providing a url, selecting an image from their computer, or snapping a photo on their webcam. This app will work on both desktop and mobile.

#### The list of libraries, frameworks, APIs we will use:
* Microsoft Azure Face API
* Webcam API, Bootstrap, React
